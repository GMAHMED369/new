Hey guys this is my firt Azure project, I have created a basic HTML/CSS webpage and deployed on 4 servers
using Apache Server. I used Azure's load-balancers in this project to balance the load over each server.
This project basically seperates the users from India and users from all other countries to two different web pages.
for example if i am searching for my-project.in form india then i will be forwarded to the Indian servers,
here i have created two servers for each i.e. for indian users and other users so either i will be forwarded to indian server 1 or indian server 2 depending on the load over a server.
